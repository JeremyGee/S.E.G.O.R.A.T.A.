% 		= done
anything else 	= not done

% Basic idea

% Set up github
	%Push/pull scripts

% map zooming/panning

% Player colours(8 of them)

% Randomly chosen starting nations

- Decide on the art style

- Creating a good test map

- GUI

- Make the pseudo turn-based system
	|Networking!
	|Notifications
		]Ability to hide in tray when it's not your turn (Easy enough)
		]Non-boring notification (i.e. not a lazy and boring balloon tool tip)

- Troop placing
	|Graphics for the different kinds of troops
	|Ability to place troops
	
- Attacking
	|Ability to select a neighbouring nation that isn't yours to invade - ability to zoom in on it and do:
	|Tactics!
		]Attacker and defender's troop objects
		]Collision/landscape
		]Realtime results once both players have readied
	
- Defending
	|Graphical notification of an attack - ability to zoom in on it and do:
	|Tactics!
		]Attacker and defender's troop objects
		]Collision/landscape
		]Realtime results once both players have readied

- Special things(i.e. defense wall)
	|Think of as much things as we can whilst keeping it fair and tactical
	|Add a global troop type: Technicians(Name to be changed?)
	|Adding objects into nations as extra collision(i.e. walls)

- AI
	|Difficulty setting
	|Play style setting
	|Smartness
		]Attacking the worst threat
			}The person with the most attacking troops certainly
			}The nearest person with actual ability and will to attack
		]Defending by placing good walls/defense troops
			}Finding bottleneck nations
			}Defend edges of connected empire, if not only continents
		]Take away continents
			}Find the easiest path to a continent
		]Know when to stop attacking and retreat
			}One tactic could be: When all seems lost, keep attacking with A only, defend with S and V
		]Good in-nation tactics
			}Todo: add stuff here
