% Basic idea

% Set up github
	%Push/pull scripts

	|Networking!
	|Notifications

- Troop placing
	|Graphics for the different kinds of troops
	|Ability to place troops
	
- Attacking
	|Ability to select a neighbouring nation that isn't yours to invade - ability to zoom in on it
	|Tactics!
		]Attacker and defender's troop objects
		]Collision/landscape
		]Realtime results once both players have readied
	
- Defending
	|Graphical notification of an attack - ability to zoom in on it
	|Tactics!
		]Attacker and defender's troop objects
